## Overview

This module uses rest client to interact with the NSX API.

## Installation

$ puppet module install vmware/nsx

## Documentation

This module uses Puppet Transport resources like our other modules, such as [vmware-vcenter](https://github.com/vmware/vmware-vcenter). The trasnport resource stores the conenction information for the rest client.

    # The name of the transport is referenced by other resource:
    transport { 'nsx':
      username => 'admin',
      password => 'vmware',
      server   => 'nsx.local',
    }

All NSX resources use the transport metaparameter to specify the NSX Manager where the resource exists.

   nsx_ssoconfig { \"config_sso\":
     ensure                        => present,
     sso_lookup_service_url        => $sso_url,
     sso_admin_username            => $sso_username,
     sso_admin_userpassword        => $sso_password,
     sso_lookup_service_thumbprint => $sso_thumbprint,
     transport                     => Transport["nsx"],
   }

See tests folder for additional examples.
